# CodeForcesTimer-Extension
## How to Install?
1. Download the repository as .zip file and extract it.
2. Open Google Chrome -> Click on Extension icon -> Manage Extensions -> Toggle on Developer Mode -> Load Unpacked Extensions -> select the extracted folder.
## How to use?
- When you click on the extension, a small window opens, allowing you to select the desired time for the Countdown timer.
- If a solution is submitted and it is accepted, the timer will display the "Time Taken" to solve the question.
- If the timer runs out and no solution is accepted, then the message 'Time Out' is displayed.
## Features
- Custom timer is available.
- The application provides an available "Start" button to initiate the timer, and a "Reset" button to enable users to reset the timer to its initial state.
- Once the timer is started, it cannot be paused. This feature has been implemented to create a contest-like environment, where participants must manage their time effectively without the option to pause the timer.
- The application can also display the time taken by the user to solve the same question in the previous attempt if the user used the extension during their last attempt.
